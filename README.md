# Java-Projects
- About The Other Side Of West - BETA 1.001
   This was made for my OOP, it's not done the way I was planning, but for now, it's just fine.
   I started this project without knowing somethings in Java, now I see things that I don't
  understand why I made that way, I made this project for 2-3 months, I learned many things
  by this time.
